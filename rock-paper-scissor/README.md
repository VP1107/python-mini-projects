# Rock Paper Scissors (Python)

A command-line Rock Paper Scissors game built using Python.
This project was created to practice Python basics such as conditionals, dictionaries, and the random module.

The repository contains two versions of the game:
- a simple version for clarity and learning
- a shortened (optimized) version with compact logic

## Project Structure

rock-paper-scissor/
├── main.py
├── main-shortened.py
└── README.md

## Game Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

The computer randomly selects a choice, and the result is displayed after comparing it with the user’s input.

## How to Run

Make sure Python is installed on your system.

Run the simple version:
```bash
python main.py
```
Run the shortened version:
```bash
python main-shortened.py
```

## Versions Explained

Simple Version
- Beginner-friendly
- Easy-to-read if-else logic
- Uses full-word inputs (stone, paper, scissor)
- Ideal for understanding basic game flow

Shortened Version
- More compact and optimized
- Uses numeric mapping and dictionaries
- Demonstrates efficient decision-making logic
- Shows how the same problem can be solved with fewer lines

---

## Concepts Used

- Python random module
- Dictionaries
- Conditional statements
- User input handling
- Game logic implementation
- Code optimization

---

## Purpose of This Project

This project was built to:
- Practice Python fundamentals
- Understand control flow and logic building
- Compare beginner vs optimized approaches
- Build confidence by completing a full mini-project

---

## Possible Improvements

- Add score tracking
- Allow multiple rounds
- Improve input validation
- Create a GUI-based version
